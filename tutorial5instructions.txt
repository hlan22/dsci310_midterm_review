Tutorial 5

1. Create a repository and clone it down

2. Create a bash script that lists (using a bash command) the files of your current working directory, the root of the repo. Name it list.sh

3. Create a dockerfile that uses the rocker/rstudio container, using version 4.2.2.

4. Copy the list.sh into the container

5. Run the script in the container

6. Document how to run the container and run the script in the container. We must follow the steps until we are able to run and see the output. Put your steps in the README.md file

7. For Tuesday: Create a github action that also runs this bash script
