2025-01-25 tutorial 3: python and r environments
Tutorial 3:

Here we'll practice with programming language environments.

If conda and python does not apply to you, you may skip the conda and python portion of the tutorial.
If you are taking, have taken, or planning to take a class that uses python it will still be worth practicing and familiarizing yourself with conda enviornments.

R Environments: renv

1. Open up RStudio
2. run `getwd()` in the r console, and note the default starting working directory in R when not in a project.
3. Create an RStudio Project (either from an existing folder, or create a new folder)
3. run `getwd()` again and see how the working directory changes
4. Install the `renv` package (if you do not have it installed)
5. Note all the current installed R packages you have in the packages panel
6. Run the `renv::init()` in the current project (you can also choose to `library(renv)` and then `init()` as 2 separate steps)
7. Now note the packages in the package panel
8. Install the `palmerpenguins` package in R
9. Library the `palmerpenguins` package
10. you should now have access to the `penguins` dataframe
11. update the lock file with `renv::snapshot()`
12. Open a new rstudio or close the current project
13. You should not be in your project now, and notice the packages listed listed. And notice how the packages change again when you open up the project you just made

 

Python Environments: conda

1. Open up a terminal, you should be in a conda base environment
2. Run `python --version` and `which python` to check the python version you have and which one is actually being used
3.  create a new conda environment with a different python verison from the one you currently have in base
4. activate this environment
5. install jupyterlab and pandas in the new environment
6. create an enviornment.yml file for your new environment. it should only list the packages you explicitly installed (not list dependencies)
7. deactivate your python enviornment
