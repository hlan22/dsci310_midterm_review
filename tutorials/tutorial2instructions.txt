Extra (we haven't seen it in class yet)
Let's create a PR with a merge conflict

11. Create a new branch from main, edit the readme file, at the top and define the follow terms

- git add
- git commit

12. push this branch and create a PR, but DO NOT merge it

13. on your local machine, go back to your main branch
14. create yet another branch from main (you should not be on your previous branch)
15. at the top of your readme file define the following terms

- git push ...
- git pull ...

16. add/commit/push your branch
17. create another PR from your second branch
18. Try to merge both branches now, you should see a merge conflict when you try to merge the 2nd branch
